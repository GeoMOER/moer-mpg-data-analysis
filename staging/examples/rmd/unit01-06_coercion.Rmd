```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path='{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/rmd_images/e01-01/')
```

Coerting data elements into one of the basic R data types is straight forward.
Just add "as." to the data type and you have the name of the respective function.
```{r}
x <- c(1.4, 2.5, 3.6, 4.0)
class(x)
as.character(x)
as.integer(x)
as.factor(x)
```
Please note that the `as.integer` function returns the floor of the floating
point values and does not apply any rounding rules.

So far, we have differentiated between data types and structures. Actually, a
vector, list or data frame is nothing but another data type and the same logic of
conversion functions can be used.
```{r}
x <- c(1.4, 2.5, 3.6, 4.0)
class(x) # i.e. vector of type numeric
as.list(x)
as.data.frame(x)
as.matrix(x)
```
