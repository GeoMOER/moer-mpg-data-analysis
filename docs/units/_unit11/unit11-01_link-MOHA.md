Save your solutions in your course repository in a folder called MOHA with subfolders for each exercise block,

Only your last published commit before passing of the deadline will be considered.

# General 

Your mission in this session is to prepare a marked assignment similar to the previous assignments, which you already know.
But this time the deadline is today at High Noon (12:00).
You will work on individual tasks and data but of the same level of difficulty.
You must use your matriculation number as seed leading to individual results for each participant.
The single assignments within the MOHA must not be passed independently.


# Rules

**You are ALLOWED to**
* use your personal course material,
* use your personal R scripts,
* use the internet to gather information, and
* use AI.

**You are NOT ALLOWED to**
* interact with real persons, and to
* copypaste solutions for MOHA exercises from fellow course members (what is a bad idea anyway because of the individual results).


# Time table

Deviations from the schedule will not be accepted. The deadline will be strictly enforced.

| Title | Time          | Duration | Description                                                              | 
|-------|---------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MOHA  | 9:30  - 12:00 | 150 min  | Face your individual MOHA assignment. |


# Guidelines

* Add the text of each exercise prior to your solution and also include the name of the exercise sheet and the number of the particular tasks in order to create an easy to navigate html output. 
* Do not get lost in single exercises and have the remaining time in mind. 
* The exercises are independent from each other and can be solved in any order.
* Alternative solutions deviating from those provided in the course are welcome.
