[Start MOHA](https://ilias.uni-marburg.de/data/UNIMR/lm_data/lm_2926426/index.html){:target="_blank"}
(available 9:30 to 12:00 on Tuesday 09, 2021)

# General 

This year's MOHA consists of exercises in four different topics, each yielding the same amount of points. 
You can navigate through the topics in the panel on the left and by clicking the buttons below. 

Your mission in this session is to prepare a marked assignment similar to the previous assignments, which you already know.
But this time the deadline is today at High Noon (12:00).
You will work on individual tasks and data of the same level of difficulty 
and must use your matriculation number as seed leading to individual results for each participant.
This assignment must not be passed independently but your grade for it will be weighted like two of the previous "normal" assignments.


# Guidelines

* Add the text of each exercise prior to your solution and also include the name of the exercise sheet and the number of the particular tasks in order to create an easy to navigate html output. 
* Do not get lost in single exercises and have the remaining time in mind. 
* The exercises are independent from each other and can be solved in any order.
* Alternative solutions deviating from those provided in the course are welcome.


# Rules

### You are ALLOWED to
* use your personal course material,
* use your personal R scripts,
* use the internet to gather information, and
* interact with your fellow course members.


### You are NOT ALLOWED to
* interact with persons who are not part of the course, and to
* copypaste solutions for MOHA exercises from fellow course members (what is a bad idea anyway because of the individual results).

# Time table

Deviations from the schedule will not be accepted. The deadline will be strictly enforced.

<br/>


# Deliverables

Save your solutions in **one Rmd file** and create **one html file** from it for each of the four exercise blocks. 
If, and only if, it is impossible for whatever reason to not create a html file, you can upload only the Rmd files. 
In this case, state why the html output creation failed.


Save your solutions in your course repository in a folder called MOHA with subfolders for each exercise block, 
update (i.e. commit) your local repository and publish (i.e. push) it to the GitHub classroom. 
**Make sure that the created html files are also part of your GitHub repository**. 
Only your last published commit before passing of the deadline will be considered.
