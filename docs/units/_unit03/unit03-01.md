You already came up with some guiding questions as part of [DP: Questions and work packages]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _unit01/unit01-02.md %}). They focus on potential differences between productivity dynamics of primary (Beech) and other forests and the influence/buffering of climatic fluctuations by primary forests. Let's put this and the processed MODIS data resulting from [Unit02]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _unit02/unit02-01.md %}) into a little perspective before we dive into our analysis.

## Primary Beech Forests of Romania

Colleagues from HNE Eberswalde have jointly published a report Greenpeace Romania and Cuza University of Ilasi on the potential primary Beech forest extent in Romania.

The report along with a short publication statement can be found at the web-space of the [Centre for Econics and Ecosystem Management](http://www.centreforeconics.org/news-and-events/press-release-downloads/map-of-romanian-potential-primary-forests/). Let's use it as a starting point and focus our analysis on the Romanian region of the Carpathian mountains. 


## 21st-Century Forest Cover Change

While regionally focusing on Romania, we should also consider the role of disturbances at or in the vicinity of forest locations. A recent key publication related to a detailed dataset is the one from [Hansen et al. (2013)](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6160/850). The corresponding dataset can be downloaded from the [University of Maryland](https://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest).
