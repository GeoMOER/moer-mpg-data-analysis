title: Look at Your Data
---

This unit shifts the focus from a technical to a content oriented perspective. Since data analysis requires some kind of data and since data is often provided in a digital way, reading and writing data is a standard operation. Typically, the next steps involve the computation of some kind of summary statistic and some visual data exploration.


## Learning objectives
At the end of this unit you should be able to
* read and write tabulated data,
* compute some summary statistics, 
* use R's basic plot functionality to quickly visualize your data.
