## Automatic processing of MODIS data using the R package functions 
Now that a first reviewed version of the [beechForestDynamics](https://github.com/marburg-open-courseware/beechForestDynamics){:target="_blank"} is at hand, use the functionality to implement a script which handles the MODIS processing automatically following the template provided in [project_beech_dynamics](https://github.com/marburg-open-courseware/project_beech_dynamics){:target="_blank"} and already used as part of [Unit02 | PA: R Package]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _unit02/unit02-02.md %}).


## Programming assignment
*Please implement an automatic script which processes the MODIS data automatically. Use the file from [project_beech_dynamics](https://github.com/marburg-open-courseware/project_beech_dynamics){:target="_blank"} as a template for that task. If you notice bugs in the R Package, fix them!*


**Sample data** Datasets for one tile extent are provided via the UMR Box. There is also a data_small folder with reduced raster dimensions. It is a good idea to use the small data (at least for the first trial run) and save the freshly created output data in a different location. In doing so one can check if the results match with the provided data.
