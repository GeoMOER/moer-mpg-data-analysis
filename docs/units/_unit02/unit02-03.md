title: "PR: Function review and bug fixing"
---

Implementing an R Package is and keeping track of all things is quite a headache. Hence, we will cross check the functions following a peer review approach.

## Peer review assignment
*Please review the functions of another peer from the [beechForestDynamics](https://github.com/marburg-open-courseware/beechForestDynamics){:target="_blank"} R package. If the functions need some enhancement or bug fixing, fill an issue on the GitHub page.*

*Once you have finished your review, check for issues filled for your own functions and handle them appropriately.*
