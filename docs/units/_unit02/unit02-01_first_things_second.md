## Learning objectives
At the end of this unit you should be able to
* tell the difference between data sets, data types and data structures,
* use logical and boolean operators to make decisions,
* use loops for repeated tasks,
* consider some basic code styling rules in your scripts.

## Control structures
Control structures are used to make decisions during runtime, i.e. while the code is executed. Such decisions can be 
* if something happens, do something; otherwise, do something else
* do something n times
* do something until something is happening
