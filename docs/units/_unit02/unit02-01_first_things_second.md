After getting in contact with some variables and data structures already, we will make one step back and clarify such terms as data sets, data types etc. Afterwards, we will have a look at probably the most important feature of programming languages, namely run-time control structures.

## Learning objectives
At the end of this unit you should be able to
* tell the difference between data sets, data types and data structures,
* use logical and boolean operators to make decisions,
* use loops for repeated tasks,
* consider some basic code styling rules in your scripts.

## Control structures
Control structures are used to make decisions during runtime, i.e. while the code is executed. Such decisions can be 
* if something happens, do something; otherwise, do something else
* do something n times
* do something until something is happening
