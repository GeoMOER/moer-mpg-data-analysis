## One R package, one script collection and two GitHub repositories

Using the readily available scripts as a basis we will create an R package for the more general functionality and an R script collection (e.g. R Studio project or just a folder with scripts) for the more specific tasks. Each will be added to two separate git repositories served on [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"}:

* We will put all general functions (i.e. the R package) into a repository called [beechForestDynamics](https://github.com/marburg-open-courseware/beechForestDynamics){:target="_blank"}.
* We will put all tailored analysis scripts into a repository called [project_beech_dynamics](https://github.com/marburg-open-courseware/project_beech_dynamics){:target="_blank"}. This respository already holds the (messy) script we build our work on.

Depending on what will happen later, we can sort something out more sophisticated.

## Programming assignment
*Please use the scripts provided in the GitHub repository [project_beech_dynamics](https://github.com/marburg-open-courseware/project_beech_dynamics){:target="_blank"} and create an R package for general functions and a script collection for more specific functionality. Sufficiently document the code using [Roxygen2](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/man.html){:target="_blank"} so others can use it, too.*

**Working examples and testing** In order to test your scripts it is feasibly to include some testing data into the R package which can also be used within the @examples section of the documentation. Have a look on the [documentation](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/man.html){:target="_blank"} and [data](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/inst.html){:target="_blank"} section in [Hadley Wickham's package guide](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/data.html){:target="_blank"}.
