After finishing your analysis, it is time to communicate your results. 

## Short note assignment
*Please write a short note on your analysis question, methods, results and critical discussion of your findings.*



**Structure of your short note** Have a look at [Detsch et al. 2016](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/8/2/159/htm) for structuring your short note. Given the focus of this module, you can keep the research overview very short. To embed your research question, about two sentences of background information are sufficient. The short note should not extend 2,500 words and include meaningful figures and/or tables.
