This course is intended as a blended learning module, although the provided introductions, explanations and examples might be useful for self-study only, too.
<!--more-->

Our first course session will be virtual. Details on the virtual classroom and how to get there are provided on the front page and were send by email to all participants.
Subsequent sessions will be in a hybrid format, meaning that parts of the students may attend the sessions in person at the [Department of Environmental Informatics](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en/fb19/disciplines/physisch/environmentalinformatics){:target="_blank"} in Marburg. The room number is 00A12.
<!-- GeoAI change to: "00A19" -->


## HTML learning environment

Your primary learning environment is this public homepage, which was created on GitHub.
Here you find all learning materials, assignment tasks, and help.
The structure is linear, so just work your way through it. 
Of course you can also jump freely between units, but this is not recommended for beginners.


## Flexible learning with deadlines

You will use the learning material provided in the HTML learning environment(s) for solving the given assignment tasks.
The sessions on Tuesdays will be used for discussing the assignments.

Note that you are flexible in solving your assignment tasks using the material provided in the HTML learning environment (and beyond), but the deadlines for submitting your solutions must be met.
For details see the ["Deliverables*](/moer-mpg-data-analysis/unit00/unit00-02_deliverables.html) section.

## Virtual meeting rooms

We will use [Big Blue Button](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en/hrz/services/web-conferences/web-conferencing-with-bigbluebutton){:target="_blank"} as main virtual classroom for our synchronous (hybrid) sessions.
The link to our classroom can be found in [Ilias](https://ilias.uni-marburg.de/goto.php?target=crs_2593121&client_id=UNIMR){:target="_blank"}.
Additionally, there are student meeting rooms in our course environment in Ilias, which you can freely use on your own for discussing the assignments.


## Ilias

Ilias is the course space offered by the University of Marburg. 
We will use Ilias mainly for the administration of the course and for providing small static documents.
The link to the Ilias space for this course can be found [here](https://ilias.uni-marburg.de/goto.php?target=crs_2593121&client_id=UNIMR){:target="_blank"}.
Note that you have to log in with your student account. There is also a forum in Ilias, which you can use for getting in touch with your fellow students.



## GitHub Classroom

You will use GitHub Classroom for uploading your assignments and for getting familiar with git.
The link for joining our GitHub Classroom can be found in Ilias.
