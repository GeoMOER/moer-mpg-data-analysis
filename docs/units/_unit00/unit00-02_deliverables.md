We distinguish between unmarked and marked deliverables ("Studien- und Pr√ºfungsleistung"). Both are required for passing the course but only the latter is marked, making up your final grade for the course.

Students will need to deliver marked and unmarked assignments on a regular basis ("homework") and must end the course with a (team) project work, which will also be marked.
Details on the assignments and whether they will be marked or not can be found in the respective units.

More details will follow in the future. Check out our [FAQ]({{ "/faq.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) page for updates, too.
