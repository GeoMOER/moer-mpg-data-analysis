## Assignments
We distinguish between unmarked and marked deliverables ("Studien- und Prüfungsleistung"). 
Both are required for passing the course but only the latter are marked.
Students will need to deliver marked (4) and unmarked (6) assignments on a regular basis ("homework") within one week.
Details on the assignments and whether they will be marked or not can be found in the respective units.

## MOHA
Additionally, there will be a marked assignment, which needs to be submitted directly at the end of the respective session in the second half of the semester -- the MOHA (Marburg Open Hackathon).
Tasks for the MOHA will be selected from all units.


## Final grade
Your final grade will consist of the marked assignments and the MOHA.
You may use the following lines of code for calculating your final grade, for example:

```r
assignment_1 <- 5
assignment_2 <- 6
assignment_3 <- 7
assignment_4 <- 8
MOHA <- 9

final_grade <- round(0.5 * (assignment_1 + assignment_2 + assignment_3 + assignment_4) / 4 + 0.5 * MOHA)
final_grade
```




Note that you do not have to achieve five points in each assignment or the MOHA.
However, passing the course requires at least five points in regard to your final grade.
