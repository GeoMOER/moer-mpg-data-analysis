Our first course session will be virtual only. Details on the virtual classroom and how to get there are provided on the front page and were send by email to all participants.
Subsequent sessions will be in a hybrid format, meaning that parts of the students may attend the sessions in person at the [Department of Environmental Informatics](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en/fb19/disciplines/physisch/environmentalinformatics){:target="_blank"} in Marburg. The room number is 00A12.

We will use [Big Blue Button](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en/hrz/services/web-conferences/web-conferencing-with-bigbluebutton){:target="_blank"} as virtual classroom for our synchronous (hybrid) sessions.
The Link to our classroom will be provided by the instructor and can additionally be found in Ilias.
