This course is intended as a blended learning module, although the provided introductions, explanations and examples might be useful for self-study only, too.
<!--more-->

Our first course session will be virtual. Details on the virtual classroom and how to get there are provided on the front page and were send by email to all participants.
Subsequent sessions will be in a hybrid format, meaning that parts of the students may attend the sessions in person at the [Department of Environmental Informatics](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en/fb19/disciplines/physisch/environmentalinformatics){:target="_blank"} in Marburg. The room number is 00A12.

## HTML learning environment

Your primary learning environment is this public homepage, which was created on GitHub.
Here you find all learning materials, assignment tasks, and help.


## Flexible learning with deadlines

The sessions on Tuesdays will be used for discussing the assignments.

## Virtual meeting rooms

We will use [Big Blue Button](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en/hrz/services/web-conferences/web-conferencing-with-bigbluebutton){:target="_blank"} as main virtual classroom for our synchronous (hybrid) sessions.
The link to our classroom can be found in [Ilias](https://ilias.uni-marburg.de/goto.php?target=crs_2593121&client_id=UNIMR){:target="_blank"}.
Additionally, there are student meeting rooms in our course environment in Ilias, which you can freely use on your own for discussing the assignments.

We will use Ilias mainly for the administration of the course and for providing small static documents.
