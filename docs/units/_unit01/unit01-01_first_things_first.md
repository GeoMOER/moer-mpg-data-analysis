title: First Things First
---

In this unit we make a brute force introduction to R, R markdown, the RStudio IDE, version management with Git and GitHub's classroom functionality. While - from a learning theory point of view - this does not really represent anything but a worst case example, these are the things you need to know to solve the upcoming assignment problems and submit your solutions. Hence, let's just do it and then start all over again in the next unit.

## Learning objectives
At the end of this unit you should be able to
* tell the difference between an R and an R markdown script
* create an R and R markdown script and run and compile it respectively
* sign in to the class assignment of this course at GitHub and clone and push your course repository between the GitHub server and your local computer
* put an R markdown (or any other) file into your Git repository, commit it locally and push it to the server

## Why data analysis, why R

“Most scientific disciplines are finding the data deluge to be extremely challenging, and tremendous opportunities can be realized if we can better organize and access the data.” [(Science 331, 2011)](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6018/692.full){:target="_blank"}
