## Guiding questions and workpackages
Before jumping directly into planning the analysis workflow, take your time and define some questions, hypothesis and/or aims of your study. This is the most important task in data anlysis and modeling since these questions will guide you through your analysis and ensure - if sticked to it - that the resulting information and its discussion will actually match your initial objective.

Once such questions are at hand, the selection of datasets, methods and models is the next step. This includes

* the datasets used for the analysis,
* if necessary the spatial and temporal resolution of the analysis and its spatial and temporal extent, and
* the models/analysis methods.

If one has an idea of the above aspects, it is time for a more detailed planing of

* the necessary pre-processing of the datasets and
* the actual analysis workflow.
 
## Group discussion prompt
*Please discuss the overall objective of the study with your peers and agree on something between three and five guiding questions. Use these questions to collaboratively define and graphically illustrate an analysis workflow.*
