## Working environment
For this course, we do not provide a mandatory template for your working environment. However it is a good idea to have something like this:

  * top level folder for this course, e.g. *<some-path-to-your-data-disk>\data_analysis*,
  * a *data* folder within your top level folder which also contains a *tmp* folder for temporary files and different subfolders for datasets and/or assignments within this course,
  * a folder for your personal GitHub classroom repository and different subfolders within, one for each assignment and one for scripts and functions which are useful for more than one assignment.
  
Hence, your data structure could look like this:

```yaml
<some-path-to-your-data-disk>\data_analysis
  |-- data
    |-- assignment_01
    |-- assignment_02
    |-- ...
    |-- tmp
  |-- <your-github-learning-log-repository>
    |-- assignment_01
    |-- assignment_02
    |-- ...
    |-- functions
```

Be aware that your git repository will ignore folders as long as there are no files within them.
{: .notice--info}

Do not use any spaces within your folder or filenames until you become an expert. **At no time**. **Never**. 
{: .notice--danger}

Be aware that a proper organization of the data is the basis for re-use of your data and code as well as for the reproducibility of your analysis.
