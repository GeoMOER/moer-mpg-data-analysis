Data analysis is a key competence for professional geographers that requires profound knowledge in both (statistical) analysis methods and computer sciences. While the reason for the former is obvious, the latter is a direct result of a growing data deluge, induced by technological progress on both the fields of data collection and distribution. 

Data analysis is based on a variety of skills related to organizing, handling, describing and understanding a diversity of datasets. 
By using the programming environment R, this course will not just open the door to a cosmos of data analysis functionality but will moreover provide a domain specific and flexible tool for workflow automation.

# Intended learning outcomes
At the end of this course you should be able to
  
* organize a variety of datasets and (intermediate) analysis results in structured fashion,
* document your workflow in an understandable and transparent manner, collaborate in teams and handle issues and task management using Git and GitHub as software management tool and platform,
* implement data analysis workflows using tailored R scripts along with readily available functions from third-party R packages,
* model relationships between data variables and calculate reliable error estimates, and to
* critically evaluate your analysis.



# Setting

This course will take place in a hybrid synchronous setting in presence in room **F 14 | 00A19**.
In addition, there will be regular meetings with a tutor. 
Details on the additional tutor sessions will be provided in the first regular session, 
which will take place on **Tuesday 22.10.2024 at 9:15 am** in room F 14 | 00A19.
The virtual room for online participants will be announced by email.
Note that the tutor sessions are voluntary.

# Deliverables

The graded course certificate will be based on an individual portfolio hosted as a personal repository on GitHub. 
The individual portfolio items are defined in the respective course assignments along with the information if they will be marked or not.


# Preparation and prerequisites

The course assumes basic knowledge and skills in R and geo-information science.

This course uses additionally provided material for teaching basic R skills, 
which can be found [here](https://geomoer.github.io/moer-base-r/){:target="_blank"}.
