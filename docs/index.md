  title: Intended learning outcomes
  excerpt: "At the end of this course you should be able
  
    * to organize a variety of datasets and (intermediate) analysis results in structured fashion,
	
	* to document your workflow in an understandable and transparent manner, collaborate in teams, and handle issues and task management using Git and GitHub as software management tool and plattform,
	
	* to implement data analysis workflows using tailored R scripts along with readily available functions from third-party R packages,

	* to model relationships between data variables and calculate reliable error estimates,

	* to critically evaluate your software scripts for potential improvements.

Data analysis is a key competence of professional geographers but it requires profound knowledge in both (statistical) analysis methods and computer sciences. While the reason for the former is obvious, the latter is a direct result of a growing data deluge, induced by technological progress on both the field of data collection and the one of data distribution. 

Data analysis requires a variety of skills related to the organizing, handling, analyzing and describing a diversity of datasets. Using R this course will not just open the door to a cosmos of data analysis functionality but also provide a domain specific and flexible (also not really ideal) tool for workflow automation.

# Course features

The course provides a basis for the parallel [Geo Information Systems](https://oer.uni-marburg.de/ilias.php?ref_id=327&cmdClass=ilrepositorygui&cmdNode=r5&baseClass=ilrepositorygui){:target="_blank"} and [Remote Sensing](https://oer.uni-marburg.de/ilias.php?ref_id=326&cmdClass=ilrepositorygui&cmdNode=r5&baseClass=ilrepositorygui){:target="_blank"} courses. It is intended as a blended learning module in our study program although the provided introductions, explanations and examples might be useful for self-study, too.
