Data analysis is a key competence of professional geographers but it requires profound knowledge in both (statistical) analysis methods and computer sciences. While the reason for the former is obvious, the latter is a direct result of a growing data deluge, induced by technological progress on both the field of data collection and the one of data distribution. 

Data analysis requires a variety of skills related to the organizing, handling, analyzing and describing a diversity of datasets. Using R this course will not just open the door to a cosmos of data analysis functionality but also provide a domain specific and flexible (also not really ideal) tool for workflow automation.

# Intended learning outcomes
At the end of this course you should be able
  
* to organize a variety of datasets and (intermediate) analysis results in structured fashion,
* to document your workflow in an understandable and transparent manner, collaborate in teams and handle issues and task management using Git and GitHub as software management tool and plattform,
* to implement data analysis workflows using tailored R scripts along with readily available functions from third-party R packages,
* to model relationships between data variables and calculate reliable error estimates,
* to critically evaluate your analysis.

# Course features

The course provides a basis for the parallel [Geo Information Systems](https://oer.uni-marburg.de/goto.php?target=crs_327&client_id=mriliasmooc){:target="_blank"} and [Remote Sensing](https://oer.uni-marburg.de/goto.php?target=crs_326&client_id=mriliasmooc){:target="_blank"} courses. It is intended as a blended learning module in our study program although the provided introductions, explanations and examples might be useful for self-study, too.
