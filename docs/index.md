Field surveys generally face the compromise between their level of detail, their extend and their temporal repetition. One can either study selected processes in detail on a very limited number of observation sites or focus on a more landscape oriented survey using more generalized observations. The restrictions can be loosened by linking survey information to area wide remote sensing observations and the modelling of raster maps which can further be used for scientific analysis. 

Remote sensing has a history of more than 150 years and is a well established, cost-effective and powerful tool but it has to be applied with caution in order to gain robust results. The advent of high performance computing along with machine learning algorithms has just opened up a new chapter in data mining and information retrieval using a wide variety of ground-based, airborne and satellite sensors. This requires a large variety of skills related to data handling, machine learning, team-based software development and workflow documentation and the presentation and discussion of results. 

This course provides room for an intensive experience in advanced remote sensing data analysis.

# Course features

The course is integrated in the research of the Nature 4.0 project, heavily linked to the parallel [Geo Information Systems](https://oer.uni-marburg.de/ilias.php?ref_id=327&cmdClass=ilrepositorygui&cmdNode=r5&baseClass=ilrepositorygui){:target="_blank"} and [Data Analysis](https://oer.uni-marburg.de/ilias.php?ref_id=326&cmdClass=ilrepositorygui&cmdNode=r5&baseClass=ilrepositorygui){:target="_blank"} courses. It is intended as a blended learning module in our study program although the provided introductions, explanations and examples might be useful for self-study, too.



# Syllabus

| Session | Topic | Content |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Remote Sensing in next-generation nature conservation | Get to know basic remote sensing principles, the Nature 4.0 project approach and the study area of this course |
| Seeing the the crowns for the wood |||
| 2 | Delineating objects in remotely sensed imagery | Research and present common techniques and find similarities and differences |
| 3 | Identifying trees in the wood | Develop a workflow for delineating tree crowns and evaluate your task management with your peers |
| 4 | Communicate your findings | Document your methods and results and critically evaluate your findings. |

| Seeing the tree species for the wood |||



# Deliverables

The course requires peer review activities as part of the workflow management and software development, the computation of two remote sensing products according to problem solving assignments and a scientific poster presentation that introduces, describes and discusses the delivered remote sensing products.




# Preparation and prerequisites

The courses assumes basic knowledge and skills in remote sensing and GIS. Required R and GIS skills can be developed by the parallel courses [Data Analysis](https://oer.uni-marburg.de/ilias.php?ref_id=326&cmdClass=ilrepositorygui&cmdNode=r5&baseClass=ilrepositorygui){:target="_blank"} and [Geo Information Systems](https://oer.uni-marburg.de/ilias.php?ref_id=327&cmdClass=ilrepositorygui&cmdNode=r5&baseClass=ilrepositorygui){:target="_blank"}.
