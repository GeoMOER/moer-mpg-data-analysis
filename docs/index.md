Data analysis is a key competence for professional geographers that requires profound knowledge in both (statistical) analysis methods and computer sciences. While the reason for the former is obvious, the latter is a direct result of a growing data deluge, induced by technological progress on both the fields of data collection and distribution. 

Data analysis is based on a variety of skills related to organizing, handling, describing and understanding a diversity of datasets. 
By using the programming environment R, this course will not just open the door to a cosmos of data analysis functionality but will moreover provide a domain specific and flexible tool for workflow automation.

# Intended learning outcomes
At the end of this course you should be able to
  
* organize a variety of datasets and (intermediate) analysis results in structured fashion,
* document your workflow in an understandable and transparent manner, collaborate in teams and handle issues and task management using Git and GitHub as software management tool and platform,
* implement data analysis workflows using tailored R scripts along with readily available functions from third-party R packages,
* model relationships between data variables and calculate reliable error estimates, and to
* critically evaluate your analysis.

# Course features

The course provides a basis for the parallel [Geo Information Systems](https://ilias.uni-marburg.de/data/UNIMR/lm_data/lm_2092236/index.html){:target="_blank"} and [Remote Sensing](https://ilias.uni-marburg.de/data/UNIMR/lm_data/lm_2285471/index.html){:target="_blank"} courses. It is intended as a blended learning module in our study program although the provided introductions, explanations and examples might be useful for self-study, too.
